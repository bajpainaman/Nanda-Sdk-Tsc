# Future Implementation

This directory contains prototype implementations of the reputation system client interfaces. 

These files are excluded from the build process because they are not yet fully functional. They serve as a design reference for how the reputation system client should be implemented in the future.

The following components are included:

- `client/index.ts`: Main reputation client that integrates all components
- `client/data.ts`: Client for collecting reputation data
- `client/reviews.ts`: Client for managing server reviews
- `client/verification.ts`: Client for working with server verification

To make these implementations work, they would need:

1. Proper schema implementations for request/response validation
2. API endpoints in the server
3. Integration with the actual client request mechanism

For now, only the utilities and types from the reputation system are exported and functional:

- Types and interfaces
- Algorithm utilities
- Storage implementations
- Badge generation

When ready to implement the client functionality, move these files back to the main reputation directory and update the import paths.
