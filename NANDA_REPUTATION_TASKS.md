# NANDA Reputation System Implementation Tasks

This document provides a step-by-step guide for implementing a toolkit that enables developers to build their own reputation systems for the NANDA protocol, building on the existing TypeScript SDK. Unlike traditional reputation systems that calculate scores directly, we're focusing on creating the building blocks, data structures, and interfaces that developers need to implement their own reputation algorithms.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning implementation, ensure you have:

1. Cloned the TypeScript SDK repository
2. Installed all dependencies with `npm install`
3. Familiarized yourself with the SDK structure
4. Read the NANDA_REPUTATION_SYSTEM.md document

## Task 1: Implement Core Data Structures

**Goal**: Create the foundational data structures that developers need to build reputation systems.

1. Create a new file: `src/types/reputation.types.ts` with the following interfaces:
   - `IReputationDataComponents`: Defines components that can inform reputation
   - `IUserReview`: Structure for user-submitted reviews
   - `IReputationScore`: Common interface for reputation scores
   - `IVerificationStatus`: Structure for verification data

2. The interfaces should match the specifications in the NANDA_REPUTATION_SYSTEM.md document.

3. Add proper JSDoc documentation to explain each field and its purpose.

## Task 2: Create Reputation Data Collection Tools

**Goal**: Create the tools for collecting data that informs reputation.

1. Create a new file: `src/client/reputation-data.ts` that implements:
   - `getReputationData(serverId: string): Promise<IReputationDataComponents>`
   - `getPerformanceMetrics(serverId: string, period: string): Promise<PerformanceMetrics>`
   - `getVerificationStatus(serverId: string): Promise<IVerificationStatus>`
   - `getFeedbackData(serverId: string): Promise<FeedbackData>`
   - `getUsageStatistics(serverId: string): Promise<UsageStatistics>`

2. These functions should call the appropriate API endpoints to collect the data that developers can use in their reputation algorithms.

3. Add comprehensive error handling and TypeScript typing.

## Task 3: Implement Algorithm Interface

**Goal**: Create the interface for pluggable reputation algorithms.

1. Create a new file: `src/utils/reputation-algorithm.ts` with:
   - `IReputationAlgorithm` interface as defined in the system architecture
   - Basic implementation of helper functions for time decay, confidence calculation, etc.

2. Create a template algorithm implementation:
   - `createWeightedAlgorithm(config): IReputationAlgorithm`

3. This should be structured as a factory pattern that developers can use to create customized algorithms.

## Task 4: Create Review Management Tools

**Goal**: Build tools for managing user reviews.

1. Create a new file: `src/client/reviews.ts` with functions:
   - `getServerReviews(serverId: string, page?: number, limit?: number): Promise<ServerReviews>`
   - `submitReview(serverId: string, rating: number, reviewText?: string): Promise<UserReview>`
   - `updateReview(reviewId: string, updates: ReviewUpdates): Promise<UserReview>`
   - `deleteReview(reviewId: string): Promise<void>`
   - `markReviewHelpful(reviewId: string): Promise<void>`
   - `flagReview(reviewId: string, reason: string): Promise<void>`

2. These functions should handle the mechanics of review management without imposing any specific reputation calculation.

## Task 5: Implement Verification Integration

**Goal**: Create tools for working with verification information.

1. Create a new file: `src/client/verification.ts` with functions:
   - `getVerificationStatus(serverId: string): Promise<IVerificationStatus>`
   - `getVerificationHistory(serverId: string): Promise<VerificationHistory>`
   - `requestVerification(serverId: string, method: string): Promise<VerificationRequest>`
   - `getVerificationBadge(serverId: string, format: string): Promise<VerificationBadge>`

2. These functions should integrate with the verification system but provide flexibility for developers to use verification data in their own reputation calculations.

## Task 6: Create Analytics Integration Tools

**Goal**: Provide tools for collecting and analyzing performance data.

1. Create a new file: `src/client/analytics.ts` with functions:
   - `getPerformanceMetrics(serverId: string, period: string): Promise<PerformanceMetrics>`
   - `getErrorAnalysis(serverId: string): Promise<ErrorAnalysis>`
   - `getUsagePatterns(serverId: string): Promise<UsagePattern>`
   - `detectAnomalies(serverId: string, metricType: string): Promise<AnomalyDetection>`

2. These functions should retrieve analytics data that can inform reputation calculations.

## Task 7: Implement Storage Adapters

**Goal**: Provide interfaces for storing reputation data.

1. Create a new file: `src/utils/reputation-storage.ts` with:
   - `IReputationStorage` interface
   - Implementation of `LocalReputationStorage` for development
   - Example of `DatabaseReputationStorage` for production

2. Include methods for:
   - `saveReputationScore(score: IReputationScore): Promise<void>`
   - `getReputationScore(serverId: string): Promise<IReputationScore | null>`
   - `getReputationHistory(serverId: string): Promise<IReputationScore[]>`

## Task 8: Create UI Components

**Goal**: Provide customizable UI components for displaying reputation information.

1. Create a new directory: `src/ui/` with React components:
   - `ReputationBadge.tsx`: Display reputation scores
   - `RatingInput.tsx`: Component for inputting ratings
   - `ReviewsList.tsx`: Component for displaying reviews
   - `VerificationBadge.tsx`: Component for showing verification status

2. Make these components highly customizable with theming and styling options.

3. Add comprehensive props documentation and TypeScript typings.

## Task 9: Build Example Implementations

**Goal**: Create example implementations that demonstrate the toolkit.

1. Create a new directory: `examples/reputation/` with:
   - `simple-average.ts`: Basic rating average implementation
   - `weighted-multi-factor.ts`: Advanced multi-factor implementation
   - `community-based.ts`: Implementation with community governance

2. These should demonstrate different approaches to reputation calculation using the toolkit.

## Task 10: Integrate with Main SDK

**Goal**: Integrate the reputation system with the main SDK.

1. Create a new file: `src/client/reputation.ts` that brings together all components:
   - Export all data types and interfaces
   - Export all utility functions
   - Export all UI components

2. Update `src/index.ts` to include the new reputation module.

3. Ensure backward compatibility with existing SDK functionality.

## Task 11: Write Documentation

**Goal**: Provide comprehensive documentation for developers.

1. Create a new file: `docs/reputation-system.md` that explains:
   - Overview of the reputation toolkit
   - Available data structures and APIs
   - How to implement custom algorithms
   - Best practices and examples

2. Include code examples for common use cases:
   - Basic rating system
   - Multi-factor reputation system
   - Time-decayed reputation
   - Confidence metrics

3. Create Storybook stories for UI components if applicable.

## Task 12: Create Tests

**Goal**: Ensure reliability of the reputation toolkit.

1. Create test files for each new module:
   - `src/types/reputation.types.test.ts`
   - `src/client/reputation-data.test.ts`
   - `src/utils/reputation-algorithm.test.ts`
   - etc.

2. Include tests for:
   - Data structure validation
   - API integration
   - Algorithm correctness
   - UI component rendering

3. Ensure good test coverage for all functionality.

## Important Implementation Notes

1. **Developer Flexibility**: The key principle is to provide tools, not prescribe solutions. All components should be designed to be combined and customized.

2. **Type Safety**: Use strong TypeScript typing throughout to ensure developer confidence.

3. **Documentation**: Provide thorough JSDoc comments and examples.

4. **Modular Design**: Keep functionality modular to allow developers to use only what they need.

5. **Algorithm Templates**: Provide templates but make it clear that developers must implement their own algorithms.

6. **Examples**: Create comprehensive examples that demonstrate different approaches.

## Testing Your Implementation

After completing each task, test the functionality using:

```bash
npm test
```

You should also create example implementations that demonstrate the toolkit's capabilities:

```bash
npm run build
node examples/reputation/simple-average.js
```

## Final Deliverables

After completing all tasks, you should have:

1. A comprehensive reputation toolkit integrated with the TypeScript SDK
2. Types and interfaces for reputation data
3. Tools for collecting reputation-related data
4. Algorithm templates and interfaces
5. UI components for displaying reputation information
6. Storage adapters for reputation data
7. Example implementations demonstrating different approaches
8. Comprehensive documentation

This implementation provides developers with all the tools needed to build reputation systems for NANDA protocol servers while giving them the flexibility to implement their own algorithms and approaches.
